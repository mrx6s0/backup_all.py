# Stant copy 

Back up all the files that you want to a pen drive, or some path in your pc. 

JUST RUN:

# chmod 775 backup_all.py 

# python backup_all.py

with your defined settings,

and then the copy is initialized. 

Just pay attention in what path or pen drive are you gonna copy the files. 

In comments in the code i explaining about that.

# More functions soon. 

Peace,
